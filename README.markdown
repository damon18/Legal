Legal
=====

This module provides a site with the ability to manage and display legal information such as terms of use
and privacy policies. It also allows the site to require that these policies be accepted during registration
and/or log-in.

This module also supports a simplistic age verification during registration.

See src/modules/Legal/docs/CHANGELOG.markdown for version history information.

Project Information
-------------------
The project is currently hosted on [Cozi](http://code.zikula.org) as the
[legal](http://code.zikula.org/legal) project. Support for the module is provided
by the Zikula community at-large, in the
[Extensions Support/Modules forum](http://community.zikula.org/module-Forum-viewforum-forum-23.htm)
on [community.zikula.org](http://community.zikula.org).

Defect reports and enhancement requests should be made in the form of tickets
opened in the Cozi project. This is the only official source of information on
defects and enhancements. Bug reports and enhancement requests made via e-mail or
posts to forums or message boards, in general, have little or no effect on the
development efforts for the module.

The source code repository for the project is hosted on GitHub under 
[zikula-modules/Legal](http://www.github.com/zikula-modules/legal). Contributors
are encouraged to fork the repository to add features and fix defects. Those
doing so are strongly encouraged to open one or more tickets on the Cozi project prior
to commencing work so that others are made aware of new features and strategies for correcting
defects, and so that they can be discussed. Once complete, use the "pull request" feature of
GitHub to request that your feature or defect be merged in with the main line of development.
Pull requests should consist of a single feature, or should consist of a single defect fix.
Pull requests should *not* combine updates for multiple features or defects unless they are
inextricably dependent. Pull requests will be handled by collaborators to the project.

Collaborators are those developers who have the ability to change the source code repository directly.
They have committed their time and energy to nurturing the development of the module over the
long term. In addition to working directly on the project code, pull requests are fulfilled or
denied by collaborators. Anyone interested in committing their time to the project can request
collaborator privileges. Their request will be evaluated by the project's current manager, with
assistance from other collaborators.
